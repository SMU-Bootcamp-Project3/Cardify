# Project 3: Cardify Application

## Description

-The "Cardify" application allows Users to create and mail simple, personalized greeting cards at a low cost.

-This application allows Users to generate "post-card" style greetings composed of an image on the front, and personalized text on the back. 

-Upon opening the application Homepage, Users will see available options for card styles. These card components and front end components are rendered with REACT. Page routes are created and rendered using GraphQL funcationality. Choosing a card will add it to their cart for future review.

-Once logged-in and authenticated with JWT funcationality, Users will be able to review saved cards, make edits, delete cards, and create new cards. Card information and User information is stored using MongoDB.

-By clicking on saved cards, the content will be loaded into the Template/Editor page.

-If a User chooses to create a new card, they will be directed to a Template/Editor page with options to choose an image, create personalized message, and enter the address for the card to be mailed.

-Users can save cards to return to in the future, or they can choose to finalize their purchase and send the card. 

-Choosing to send the card will redirect the User to the payment page, where they will enter their information to confirm the order.
