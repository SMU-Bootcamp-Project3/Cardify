# Project 3: Cardify Application

## Description

-The "Cardify" application allows Users to create and mail simple, personalized greeting cards at a low cost.

-This application allows Users to generate "post-card" style greetings composed of an image on the front, and personalized text on the back. 

-Upon opening the application Homepage, Users will be given the option to create a new card. If they are not logged-in, choosing this option will prompt Users to either log-in or create an account by redirecting them to the Login page.

-Once logged-in, Users will be taken to their Account page, where they can review saved cards, make edits, delete cards, and create new cards.

-By clicking on saved cards, the content will be loaded into the Template/Editor page.

-If a User chooses to create a new card, they will be directed to a Template/Editor page with options to choose an image, create personalized message, and enter the address for the card to be mailed.

-Users can save cards to return to in the future, or they can choose to finalize their purchase and send the card. 

-Choosing to send the card will redirect the User to the payment page, where they will enter their information to confirm the order.
